* A very stylized ocean shader, unoptimized, directly implimented in a gdvisual shader file.
* Allows for stacking a few waves which allow for height calculation in real-time (computationally ineffective).
* Parameters allow for alternation in wave smoothness, speed, height, and other aspects.
* This shader is a simple godot implimentation of the Gerstner waves from the great [catlikecoding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/flow/waves/).
