This shader is a simple godot implimentation of the Gerstner waves from the great [catlikecoding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/flow/waves/).
It uses Gerstner waves in combination with noise textures to create a wave-like effect. 

* A very stylized ocean shader, directly implimented in a gdvisual shader file.
* Uses 5 waves and a height noise texture to simulate a stylized ocean.
* Simplistic code easy to understand yet unoptimized.
* Real-time calculations are inefficient, thus this shader is not scalable.
* Limited customizability.

### WIP
* Terrain intersection
* Foam texture
